# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python-based desktop application using Tkinter that allows job seekers to create a comprehensive profile and then generate tailored resumes for specific job descriptions. The system will analyze job descriptions and customize the user's profile information to create targeted 1-2 page resumes that highlight the most relevant skills and experiences for each position.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to create and manage my professional profile, so that I can store all my relevant information in one place for resume generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a profile management interface
2. WHEN the user creates a new profile THEN the system SHALL allow input of personal information, work experience, education, skills, and achievements
3. WHEN the user saves their profile THEN the system SHALL persist the data locally for future use
4. WHEN the user reopens the application THEN the system SHALL load their existing profile data
5. IF the user modifies their profile THEN the system SHALL save the changes automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to input job descriptions, so that the system can analyze the requirements and tailor my resume accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects the resume generation option THEN the system SHALL provide a text input area for job descriptions
2. WHEN the user pastes a job description THEN the system SHALL accept and store the text for analysis
3. WHEN the job description is submitted THEN the system SHALL parse and extract key requirements, skills, and qualifications
4. IF the job description is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the system to automatically generate a tailored resume, so that I can present the most relevant information for each specific job application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests resume generation THEN the system SHALL analyze the job description against the user's profile
2. WHEN generating the resume THEN the system SHALL prioritize relevant skills, experiences, and achievements that match the job requirements
3. WHEN the resume is created THEN the system SHALL format it as a professional 1-2 page document
4. WHEN the tailoring is complete THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the generated resume
5. IF the user's profile lacks relevant information THEN the system SHALL highlight gaps and suggest additions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to export and save my tailored resumes, so that I can use them for job applications and keep records of different versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views a generated resume THEN the system SHALL provide export options (PDF, Word, or text format)
2. WHEN the user exports a resume THEN the system SHALL save the file to a user-specified location
3. WHEN the user wants to regenerate a resume THEN the system SHALL allow modifications to both profile and job description
4. WHEN multiple resumes are created THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of generated resumes with associated job descriptions
5. IF the export fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and suggest alternative formats
